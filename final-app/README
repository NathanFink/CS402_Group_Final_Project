This is my submission for the camera app assignment. 

The interface includes a function for picture taking, in which the picture will be added to the list at the bottom where you
can delete, save to your device, or share.

I did install some dependencies:

npx expo install expo-sharing
npx expo install expo-media-library
npx expo install expo-camera

and i used npm run to run the app and expo go app to test.
